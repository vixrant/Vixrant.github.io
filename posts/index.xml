I have 4 years of full-stack development experience, since I started with web development in the first year of my undergraduate program in 2017. I also have 1 year of compiler design experience since 2020. I&amp;rsquo;m more inclined towards compiler design because of the interesting challenges, along with the fundamental importance of this field.
Education Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m accepted to the Master of Science in Computer Science program at Purdue University at West Lafayette.</description></item><item><title>Lex Tutorial, with a bit of Yacc</title><link>https://vixrant.github.io/2021/03/2021-03-25-lex-tutorial-with-a-bit-of-yacc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:21:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vixrant.github.io/2021/03/2021-03-25-lex-tutorial-with-a-bit-of-yacc/</guid><description>Converted from doc.tex.

The purpose of the reinstall was to micromanage my development environment which was filled with unexpected soft-links, aliases, and binary files in random places.
Looking at my old Catalina installation retrospectively, I realised that my development set-up required only 10 applications. With better management I could easily save space on my frail laptop.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2020-07-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2020-07-01/</guid><description>Retired from mentorship role at DJSCE Unicode after 1 year of mentoring juniors</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2020-03-08/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2020-03-08/</guid><description>Delivered a workshop on &amp;ldquo;Hackathons&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Web Development with Django&amp;rdquo; at DJSCE</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2020-03-03/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2020-03-03/</guid><description>Joined CSRE, IIT Bombay as R&amp;amp;D Intern.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2020-02-22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2020-02-22/</guid><description>Mentored DJSCE ACM&amp;rsquo;s LOC Hackathon 2.0</description></item><item><title>Internship Experience - Lido Learning</title><link>https://vixrant.github.io/2019/08/2019-08-25-lido-experience/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vixrant.github.io/2019/08/2019-08-25-lido-experience/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s May 2019. Summer heat is burning my body, and so is my anticipation of getting selected at top MNC for an internship. I had applied for big name companies such as Google, Github, and IBM way back in March. However I still didn&amp;rsquo;t receive any response from these companies. I was terrified. If I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find an internship for this summer, I would miss out on learning industry-standard technologies.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2019-07-31/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2019-07-31/</guid><description>Finished my 9 week internship at Lido Learning.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2019-03-03/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2019-03-03/</guid><description>Our solution proposal to a problem was selected by Government of India, and we were one of the four finalist teams at SIH 2019 for our problem statement.</description></item><item><title>Participating solo in a hackathon</title><link>https://vixrant.github.io/2018/10/2018-10-07-kjsce-hackathon-2018/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vixrant.github.io/2018/10/2018-10-07-kjsce-hackathon-2018/</guid><description>I went to KJSCE Hackathon on 5th-6th October, 2018. As a sophomore it&amp;rsquo;s crazy to think about going to a hackathon all alone competing against 55 teams of junior or senior year students with more experience. But I wanted to try my hand at it anyway, allured by the fact that it was sponsored and recognised by some of the big companies in the industry.
I was the only person who appeared alone, that too as a sophomore.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2018-10-06/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2018-10-06/</guid><description>Won 4th position at KJSCE Hackathon &amp;lsquo;18.

The Date class is difficult to use. It only stores times in seconds and that too from Unix Epoch Time - 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z, and it disrespects Timezones for the most part.
If you say:
Date d = new Date (2018, 9, 19); You would expect it the Date object to represent 2018-Sep-19. But it actually refers to 3917-Oct-19.</description></item><item><title>Functional Programming in Java</title><link>https://vixrant.github.io/2018/09/2018-09-01-functional-programming/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vixrant.github.io/2018/09/2018-09-01-functional-programming/</guid><description>Functional programming is my favourite aspect of some languages such as JavaScript. You can do the same work in a more expressive way. For example if we want to multiply all terms in an array by 2, there are two ways to go about it in JavaScript.
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; for (let i in arr) { arr [i] *= 2; } The above method requires 3 lines of code and an extra variable to do the same work as:</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2020-08-03/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vixrant.github.io/activity/2020-08-03/</guid><description>Finished my 6 week internship at Checkapp.</description></item></channel></rss>
