I went to KJSCE Hackathon on 5th-6th October, 2018. As a sophomore it's crazy to think about going to a hackathon all alone competing against 55 teams of junior or senior year students with more experience. But I wanted to try my hand at it anyway, allured by the fact that it was sponsored and recognised by some of the big companies in the industry.

I was the only person who appeared alone, that too as a sophomore. I was scared. People were planning together, discussing the best APIs or libraries, figuring out ways to add a "WOW" factor to their project, and debating on how to pitch their final work. And I was there with my headphones on, ready to give my best with what I know.

And to my surprise, I bagged the 4th position out of 55. I was shocked when they called out my "team" name. I absolutely did not expect to be recognised. But as it turned out, everyone loved my work and dedication throughout my 30 hour journey. 4th rank may not sound like an achievement to some, but I was extremely overwhelmed by the outcome. This was the forth hackathon of my career, and the first where I was able to actually present a working prototype.

I connected with the very helpful and efficient organising committee and the admirable judges of the hackathon. When I was feeling all alone, the organisers would come and talk to me. They would smile and readily offer all possible assisstance. Even the judges of round 1 were quite helpful and curious about my project and how I managed to build it. It was a fantastic experience altogether.

Now, about the part where I went alone. I've always teamed up with some amazing people from my college. This decision taught me a lot yesterday. Here's a sum and substance of what I learned:

##### 1. Organisation

I noticed that I started asking some important questions: While working on a full stack product, how much time should I dedicate to frontend and backend? Which one deserves more priority? What features are required and what can be done later? There were so many project management decisions that I had to figure out.

Organisation is not all about the workload. Organising yourself is also equally important. Stress and time management are more important. Hackathons are meant to be enjoyed. Manage yourself in such a way that you don't feel stressed.

##### 2. Focus and dedication

It's easy to be distracted by what others are doing. Sometimes I would look at their projects and think "Well, all I have is this CRUD application while they have all this fancy ML stuff. These guys are gonna win". But that doesn't mean I should stop working on my project or waste my time. 

Dedicate yourself to what you've planned. Don't stray from your work. Focus on your todo-list. Complete what you need to complete. Don't be disappointed in what you've done. This is closely related to the next lesson that I learned.

##### 3. Positive attitude

*At no point should one feel like giving up on a competition, no matter the progress.*

Throughout the hackathon, I tried to keep a positive attitude. I was tagged as a pessimist in 2017, and I've since been working on believing in myself. Try to be upbeat in competitions. You'll start attracting people, which helps in making connections, and it'll get you through your stress and work! Just enjoy the competition!

If you feel like you can go to a hackathon alone, go for it. Try it out. It'll enlighten you about what you're capable of.

I'll definitely remember to apply what I learned here at my next hackathon.
