[UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) is a widely used implementation for unique identifiers. Java's implementation `java.util.UUID` is pretty good. You may easily use it for most cases.

UUID has private constructors. To generate an ID, use the `UUID.randomUUID ()` function.

You can checkout the full [API Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/UUID.html).
