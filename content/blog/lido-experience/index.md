It's May 2019. Summer heat is burning my body, and so is my anticipation of getting selected at top MNC for an internship. I had applied for big name companies such as Google, Github, and IBM way back in March. However I still didn't receive any response from these companies. I was terrified. If I couldn't find an internship for this summer, I would miss out on learning industry-standard technologies.

So I went online and looked for internship positions in start-ups. I interned at a start-up a year before, so I knew that if I want to learn the best technologies in a short time, I need to work at a start-up. After hours of searching and applying, I was called for an interview at an interesting start-up in South Mumbai - Lido Learning.

I was hesitant to go to the interview. The office was an hour away from my home in train, and Mumbai local trains are difficult. Plus, I had applied for those big name companies - maybe I should wait for their response? After hours of thinking, I decided to go to the office and give the interview for practice! Sounds weird, but that was my intention when I boarded the train.
When I walked into the office, I was flabbergasted. There were dozens of employees, taking tuitions, making video content, deciding questions to ask children of a range of ages. It was a different kind of start-up. Not what I had in my mind when I was applying for internships.

I sat in the lobby while the watchman went and brought someone out to meet, turns out he brought the CTO of the company, Nishu, to greet me. I had a good chat over coffee with the CTO, who was very friendly and had a good talk over coffee and my résumé. Later, he asked my future mentor, Jivitesh, to take my interview.

I was honestly not going to join the company considering the travel distance from my home, but this first impression changed my mind. I gave the interview mid-May, joined after my semester finals on 31st May 2019.

## Projects

One reason I joined Lido was that I was familiar with half of the technologies that they were using. Standard full-stack technologies such as React and NodeJS. But there was a whole slew of new tools that I wanted to learn - GraphQL, AWS, and event sourcing - and Lido allowed me to do just that.

I started off with small projects such as automating a process on our CRM software using NodeJS. Here, my mentor guided me on how to structure my project. This was a skill I couldn't have learned on my own. Later, I moved to front-end development using React. I worked on a rich-text dashboard similar to Microsoft Word, where a staff can create questions for students. Here too, I was mentored on good coding standards. These things are so minuscule yet important, we aren't taught these in college.
Here at Lido, we weren't focussed on writing CRUD APIs. We were using Hasura GraphQL, which allowed us to focus more on using the APIs than to writing them. This allowed us to make projects really fast. I worked with my mentor for setting up a good migrations-managed, do-not-screw-up-the-production kind of system for Hasura.

After the web development projects, my mentors allowed me to shift to something new. I was asked to research event sourcing and find out the difference between Apache Kafka and AWS Kinesis. We started using Kinesis and I learned a lot about how to manage large volumes of data.

Initially we started with micro-services, but later we moved on to a serverless platform using AWS lambda functions. This was the first time that I was using AWS. Some things were re-written using serverless by my friends, who joined the company on my reference.
And mind you, all of this happened in 2 months! I went from doing what I know in web development in my first month, to using exciting new technologies in my second month.

## Takeaways
From all the projects that I mentioned above, I learned a whole slew of new technologies. However, the 5 real takeaways from my internship are:

- An hour of planning saves weeks of frustration
- A project with good coding standard is self-explanatory to your co-workers
- Scalability of a project very important for a fast-moving start-up
- Work smart not hard. Grinding 9–5 isn't as important as getting things done
- Learn from your co-workers! They have so much experience in the industry, it teaches you more than academia

## Culture at LIDO
As I mentioned before, I joined Lido because I wanted to learn new things at a fast pace. Coming to office by travelling in a crowded Mumbai local train for an hour was not an easy task, especially to manage alongside regular college. But my mentor and the CTO were very understanding and allowed me to bend my working hours as long as work was getting done.
The office space in Lower Parel, Mumbai is amazing. The office itself has a very different feeling than most start-ups. It really felt like a more established start-up with a concrete idea than a "throw something at a wall and see if it sticks" kind of vibe. It was a good decision to go for the interview and work there for 2 months. If I hadn't boarded the train to give the interview, I would've missed out on learning so much. In the end, I was happy with what the company taught me and how they transformed me.
