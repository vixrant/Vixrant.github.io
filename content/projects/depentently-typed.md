title: A Dependently Typed Language for the Layman
---

I belive dependent types can help reduce 
a lot of complexity that programmers add for trivial
logic like checking if the age is in the correct range.
But programmers aren't familiar to the drastically
different languages like Idris and Agda. So, I'm 
designing a dependently typed programming language
with a syntax similar to that of Python.
