title: Powerful Type Systems for Python Developers

I believe dependent types can help reduce a lot of complexity that programmers add for trivial logic like checking if the age is in the correct range. But programmers aren't familiar to the drastically different languages like Idris and Agda. So, I'm designing a dependently typed programming language with a syntax similar to that of Python.
