I'm a sophomore in Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering - Vile Parle, majoring in Computer Engineering. I have keen interest in all fields of software development, currently specializing in full stack development. I have 9 years of programming experience, on and off since 3rd grade.

I participate in programming competitions, workshops, and hackathons around Mumbai. 

I've participated in 7 hackathons so far (Went solo in 2), bagged the 4th place at KJSCE Hackathon 2018, and competed as a finalist in India's largest hackathon - Smart India Hackathon 2019 - as a sophomore. 

I love teaching others and reading through their programs/ projects. If you spot me anywhere, feel free to talk to me! Other than software development, I love reading and striking strings on my guitar trying to produce melodious sounds.
