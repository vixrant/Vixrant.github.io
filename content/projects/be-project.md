title: Touchless interfaces for post-pandemic devices with fine gesture recognition
---

With the pandemic inducing a fear of physical contact in people, I and my group
aim to replace interfaces like touch-screens and trackpads with air gestures
for the same motions like pinch-in, pinch-out, and so on. We are using 
deep learning and depth sensing camera (XBox Kinect) for this project. The
project serves as my final year project for undergraduate program.
