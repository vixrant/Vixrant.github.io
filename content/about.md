I'm Vikrant Gajria, software engineer with interest in programming languages and compiler development. I have 4 years of full-stack development experience, since I started with web development in the first year of my undergraduate program in 2017. I also have 1 year of compiler design experience since 2020. I'm more inclined towards compiler design because of the interesting challenges, along with the fundamental importance of this field.

## Education

{{< logo src="/uploads/purdue.png" >}} Currently, I'm accepted as a **Master in Science** student by the Department of Computer Science at _Purdue University_ at West Lafayette. I plan on starting in Fall 2021 if the pandemic allows me to.

{{< logo src="/uploads/djsce.png" >}} I studied at **Bachelor in Engineering**, major in Computer Engineering, at the autonomous college _Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering (DJSCE)_ at the _University of Mumbai_ from Fall 2017 to Spring 2021, and graduated with a top-notch CGPA of 3.90 (scaled from 9.74 / 10.00).

## Work Experience

{{< logo src="/uploads/accelus.png" >}} As a senior at DJSCE, I'm currently working on PL projects as a compiler developer at _Accelus Robotics_. My job involves from developing virtual machines to translators for LinuxCNC.

{{< logo src="/uploads/lido.svg" >}} As a sophomore at DJSCE, I worked on multiple projects as a software development intern at _Lido Learning_. Apart from web development using NodeJS and React, my major contribution was in designing and deploying a message-oriented distributed architecture using AWS for serverless and microservices of the start-up.

{{< logo src="/uploads/checkapp.png" >}} As a freshman at DJSCE, I worked on a natural-language processing project as a software development intern at _Checkapp Healthcare Tech_. My project was a chatbot to accept transcript of a doctor's voice notes, and generate a medical prescription from data in the transcript. I used a combination of Dialogflow and custom data extraction algorithms from syntax tree using Python and NodeJS.

## Extra-curricular

{{< logo src="/uploads/unicode.png" >}} I was a full-stack development mentee at _DJSCE Unicode_ programming club where I developed projects in Django and React; and was later promoted to ful-stack development mentor to guide a team of 5 sophomores in NodeJS development

{{< logo src="/uploads/lit.png" >}} I volunteer to work in _DJSCE Literary Society (LIT)_ as a freshman and sophomore, and let the technical team as a junior. We organised several cultural, fun, and professional development events for students of our college. I also updated and deployed [djvu.in](https://www.djvu.in); a blogging platform for undergraduate students at DJSCE.

{{< logo src="/uploads/nss.png" >}} I was a social service volunteer for _National Service Scheme (NSS)_ at DJSCE in my sophomore and junior years. I helped organise multiple events aimed at betterment of society in Mumbai and in a remote village at Dahanu. I also developed and deployed [djsce.ac.in/nss](https://djsce.ac.in/nss); official website to summarise the activities of DJSCE NSS over the years.

{{< logo src="/uploads/josh.png" >}} As a freshman, I had a fun 3-day volunteership in Winter 2017 at _Whistling Woods, Film City_ where I helped the shooting of an educational talk show with several renowned speakers with my technical expertise.

## Skills

**Languages:** My primary language and problem solving skills are in C/ C++, Python, Javascript, Java, and Go. I'm also decently versed in Haskell, OCaml, and Lisp.

**Systems programming:** I use tools like CMake for building my C/ C++ projects, with LLVM's toolchain. Currently, I'm learning about developing LLVM frontends. I've developed custom stack-virtual machines, assemblers, compilers, and source-to-source transpilers. I'm also experienced with Arduino, AVR and STM32 programming.

**Full-stack development:** I'm well experienced in web development languages, tools and frameworks like SASS, LESS, React, Django, NodeJS, Express, FastAPI, Flask, and more. I'm experienced with cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, and in designing distributed architectures with Redis, Kafka, AWS Kinesis, MongoDB, Postgresql, ZeroMQ, MQTT, GraphQL and more.. I've also deployed websites like [djvu.in](https://www.djvu.in) and [djsce.ac.in/nss](https://djsce.ac.in/nss) on multiple platforms
